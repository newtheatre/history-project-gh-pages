Habeas Corpus is a favourite of mine if only because it’s one of the few times I’ve tried to write a naturalistic play…There are plenty of good arts - henpecked husband, frustrated wife, lecherous curate, ubiquitous char - and everyone is slightly larger than life. “\n",

Pickering is intrigued by Higgins’s boast and wagers that he cannot make good on his claim; Higgins takes on the challenge and begins an intensive make-over of Eliza’s speech, manners and dress in preparation for her appearance at the Embassy Ball. Complicating matters is Eliza’s father Alfred, a cheerfully amoral and drink-loving dustman who shows up, supposedly to save his daughter’s virtue, but in reality hoping to extract money from Higgins.\n\nMade famous by the film starring Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison, this is the tale of a girl taken from rags to riches, featuring such classic songs as ‘Wouldn’t it be loverly’, ‘On the street where you live’ and ‘Get me to the church on time’. Expect extravagant Ascot hats and an abundance of cockney jigs…\n",

The attractive and playful Lizzie, is courted by Rufus, a local youth with a criminal background and a less than encouraging future. Feeling the duty to protect his sister and his family name, Jack is forced to defend his sister, bringing him into a world completely different from his own. This new, crooked environment tests the limits of Jack’s mental endurance, facing an inner battle of whether to return to the straight and narrow of his previous life, or go through with the new demands placed on him by his criminal superiors.\n\nAn ensemble, devised piece being led by artistic director Simon Thompson (see award-winning ‘Slippery Soapbox’) and produced by NT Treasurer Jackie Lee.\n\nThe Die Is Cast…\n",

By chance she meets the Doctor’s hypochondriac son, Dennis, during her visit and learns that he is terminally ill with Brett’s Palsy.  This is the answer to her dreams as the honourable Felicity Rumpers is with child out of wedlock, a heinous crime, even in those promiscuous times.  Three months of marriage before Dennis deceases will give her respectability and a ‘legitimate’ father nine months later; but all is not as in seems in this hilarious comedy about love, sex and mopeds…\n\n",

His tale takes them to the Holy Land 30 years previously, amidst the horror of the First Crusade, where the man and his friend were spared a hanging upon agreeing to cross into enemy territory and retrieve an artefact behind which an army could take Jerusalem. As the story unfolds the landlady is forced to examine her life and reflect upon her inadequacies as well as the need for redemption that she has only a swearing, thieving, whoring, boozing old outlaw to help her find. Deus Vult is not a historical play; it is a modern play about relatable people struggling with the timeless issues of fear, loyalty and morality. Above all it is about humanity’s never-ending struggle to seek a glimmer of light in a world of filth and emptiness.\n\nDeus Vult promises to be a moving and powerful performance from a new piece of student-brewed writing.\n",

In a town defined by an accident, a crime, it explores how it’s residents feel, their reactions, and perhaps most importantly, are they to be blamed?\n\nVerbatim theatre, innovative story telling and multirolling like you’ve never seen it before, The Laramie Project is one of the most performed plays in America and considered by many to be one of the 10 best american plays of the 90’s.\n\nJournalistic.

Forced to go to the home by her mother, Mary along with the other girls, has to cope with the shame of her situation and the dawning realisation that her baby will be taken away and given up for adoption whether she likes it or not. Despite the hard hitting nature of the play, the youthfulness and positive spirit of the girls is echoed in the 1960s girl-group music which they sing along to.\n\nInspired by the real accounts and heart-breaking memories from the women Amanda Whittington interviewed, Be My Baby provides for us a glimpse into a part of our shockingly recent social history that for too long was shut away and ‘forgotten’.\n",

But, after the three friends lose their jobs, and after a chance meeting with a stranger at a bar involving a racehorse destined to win, Joe and his family and friends’ lives will change course forever. Electric Nebraska explores the central ideas that are crucial to an understanding of American national identity amidst a 70s soundtrack, while capturing the rhythmic heartbeat of a working-class community. Can we do bad things and still end up good people? When we do take our shot, and, if we dive in the river… do we always manage to swim to the other side?\n",

As the four of them enter and leave relationships with each other, trust is consistently broken with the play examining exactly how love and sex can be used as commodities. ‘Closer’ ultimately showcases a web of deceit and sexual desire, questions what is really expected of the conventional relationship, and asks whether selfish desire is at the heart of all our actions.\n",

Within a week, the young bachelor gentleman of the ghosts has fallen head over heels for the new tenant who can neither see nor hear him. Meanwhile, his best friend prepares to venture tentatively into the outside world for the first time, and the blustering patriarch of the ghost family struggles to conceal a dangerous secret from his love-starved wife, who is determined to breathe fresh passion into their long lifeless marriage. In an original musical that features everything from dancing mystics to underpaid angels and trips to the afterlife and back, everyone will be shown that it is never too late to begin life again, even if you’re already dead.\n",

Her performance is an intense reflection on her desire to be watched and liked, but also her temptation to hide from the things that scare her. Jessica is daunted by the experiences that take her into adulthood, slowly realising what her weaknesses are. Abbie is Jessica’s childhood friend, who is understanding of her insecurities. She looks after Jessica as much as she can, but can’t always be there for her. In spite of this, Abbie promises that she will never stop watching over Jessica. Infectious is a playful and moving two-woman audience-interaction show that uses improvisation. It deals with the experiences that connect us all: the stresses of becoming an adult, the long-lasting bonds we form with our loved ones, and how it feels when those bonds are broken.\n",

Over the course of her treatment, she begins to question how she has lived her life, an uncompromising strive for knowledge and intellectual brilliance – and begins to see the importance of human connection and kindness. Professor Bearing valiantly braves all eight rounds of the chemotherapy, but is told the tumour has not been completely dispelled, and there is nothing else that can be done. Through the agony of dying from a terminal illness, she learns a lesson of compassion. ‘W;t’ is a poignant and humorous look at life, death, poetry, and openness.\n",

Hilarious yet morbid, bitter yet warm, Neon is a bold new play that explores loneliness, death and transcendence, and the potential to find faith in the unlikeliest of spaces.\n",

This pushes Satan to take a day off and travel to the human world to observe God’s creations to see if their opinion of humanity is correct.\n",

Rebecca has spiralled into a cycle of rage, despair, sadness and anger she cannot control in the wake of ending a long-term relationship. Sam is discovering his new identity in a world of violence and discrimination, that is preventing him from becoming his true authentic self. When these three strangers come into contact with each other, their lives are changed forever. Passionate, complex, furious and funny, Swallow promises to be an emotional and visceral experience. One that explores the difficulties of surviving in the modern world, exposes us to the darkest corners of our minds, but reinforces the power we have to overcome even our darkest and most vulnerable moments.\n",

The play explores both her vulnerability and her strength in being ostracized in such a society where being masculine is solely confined to males.

Their only solace is imaginary friend, Benji, who provides a constant source of company and comfort in their darkest times. However, Benji is not the positive force that she first appears, and slowly turns into something more sinister. Using poetry, projection and live sound looping, this powerful yet surprisingly uplifting monologue explores loneliness, recovery and the universal need for love.\n",

Maureen’s sisters have fled their toxic home and left her single-handedly responsible to care for her mother, a thorny and abusive woman who controls Maureen’s life and denies others from offering her the one thing she seeks from life, a genuine human connection. Then Pato, the village charmer, enters Maureen’s life and offers her opportunities beyond the limited scope of her Irish home, disrupting Mag’s carefully maintained status quo, which sets in motion a tragic train of events. Looking at family bonds and the effects of abuse on the human psyche, yet handled with surprising humour, McDonagh’s darkly comic domestic piece is laced with hubris and sympathy, violence and tenderness, youth and tradition.\n",

Through a rollercoaster of both heart-warming and painful memories, this new piece of theatre explores a life from beginning to end and attempts to reassure us all that every life is unique, even if we all meet Death in the end.\n\n",

She forces herself to grow-up, and shut herself off from emotional relationships. She then meets Artie, a boy who challenges her outlook, and agrees to be his friend. After receiving advice and hearing stories from her friend Kiki and her Aunt Florence, as well as facing conflict with Artie, Heidi comes to an unexpected conclusion about herself and how she should live her life when it comes to love.\n\n‘Reverie’ by Francis Simmons (29th-30th March, Fringe)\nIn the far future, on a base deep beneath the Atlantic Ocean, a mysterious creature has broken on board and picked off the crew one by one. The two surviving crew members want nothing more than to escape, but have lost all contact with the outside world. Running low on power and supplies, all that can help them is the base’s malfunctioning computer - which has started talking to them. Their situation is only worsened by the presence of a strange woman promising the destruction of all mankind. Worst of all, neither of the survivors can be sure if anything around them is real, or simply their steady descent into insanity…\n\n‘The Pros and Cons of an Overactive Imagination’ by Cecilia Alexander (4th-5th May, Fringe)\nMaggie spends her nights dreaming and her days… also dreaming. Caught up in her own imaginations, she doesn’t realise how it affects her because who better to talk to than yourself, right? Despite family, friends and more being worried for her, there is nothing Maggie wants more than to entertain herself, and now you too.\n\n‘Shades’ by Chiara Crompton (10th-12th May, Fringe)\nTwo figures stand alone in the room of a dead man, a year on from his death. It’s been too long and not long enough. Time trips around in circles as the two linger in fragmented memories and sensations, drifting further from each other with each convolution. The long shadow that is cast obscures light, leaving each estranged from any identity existing beyond the room, their memories or him.\n\nThis experimental short play explores the murky shade left by grief and loss. It looks at its ability to corrode our perceptions of relationships, the self and even our sense of reality.\n",

The grieving Trojan widows face the prospect of slavery, and are at the mercy of the Greek leaders who are striving to fulfil a horrific prophecy in order to return home.\nThis Roman play focuses on the complexity of Trojan female stories not found in Homer’s Greek-male-centric epic. Based on Euripides’ Greek play of the same name, and written during the controversial and tumultuous period of Emperor Nero’s reign, Seneca creates a powerful and moving version of this myth, pervaded by the sinister world that he saw around him. An abstract interpretation of a script that may never have been intended for performance, Trojan Women demonstrates the universality of the consequences of war and how complex female emotion should be presented on stage, no matter the era.\n\n‘Pink Mist’ by Owen Shears (25th-28th March, In House)\n“Three boys went to Catterick. It was January, snow pitchen on the Severn, turning the brown mud white, fisherman blowing on their fingerless gloves, the current pulling their fishing lines tight. That’s how it was the morning when the three of us did what boys always have and left our homes for war.” Pink Mist follows each boy’s experience both during and after their tours to Afghanistan. Within a short period of time each return to the important women in their lives - a wife, a mother, a girlfriend - and shows how everyone must now share the psychological and physical aftershocks of their service.\n\n‘Be My Baby’ by Amanda Whittington (31st March - 3rd April, In House)\nSet in St Saviours, a Mother and Baby Home in 1964 in the north of England, the play follows Mary Adams, aged 19, unmarried and seven months pregnant. Forcibly sent there by her deeply ashamed mother, Mary – along with the other girls in the home – has to cope both with the shame and the dawning realisation that they may not be able to take their babies home, whether they like it or not.\nDespite this, and an overbearing matron, the girls’ youthful effervescence breaks through, as they sing along to the girl-group songs of the period.\n\n‘POSH’ by Laura Wade (6th-9th May, In House)\nNine members of an elite Oxford dining society with cut-glass vowels and deep pockets are meeting, intent on restoring their right to rule. Portrayed by female actors, these nine men embark on an evening of debauchery, decadence and bloody good wine - testing the limits of how far money can take you, and whether or not it can save you. Welcome to the Riot Club. The play begins with the rebirth of the Club after being exposed and shamed in the media. It follows the nine existing members through an evening of fine dining in a modest pub in the middle of England, through to an accident which could land them behind bars – far away from the comfort of their Oxford colleges.\n\n‘Wasted’ by Kate Tempest (13th-16th May, In House)\nThree old friends. One remarkable day. For Ted, Danny, and Charlotte, it’s time to take control. Make a difference. Change things. A journey through the parks, raves, and cafes of London, where life is what you make it. This is a play about love, life, and losing your mind. Kate Tempest’s fast paced dialogue integrates choral spoken-word poetry into the plot creating a vibrant and exciting play which explores the effects of drugs, death, and dreams on a group of childhood friends.\n",

Although Chekhov intended it as a comedy, and it does contain some elements of farce, Stanislavski insisted on directing the play as a tragedy. Since this initial production, directors have had to contend with the dual nature of the play. The play is often identified on the short list of the three or four outstanding plays written by Chekhov along with The Seagull, Three Sisters, and Uncle Vanya.\n\nThe play concerns an aristocratic Russian woman and her family as they return to their family estate (which includes a large and well-known cherry orchard) just before it is auctioned to pay the mortgage. While presented with options to save the estate, the family essentially does nothing and the play ends with the sale of the estate to the son of a former serf; the family leaves to the sound of the cherry orchard being cut down. The story presents themes of cultural futility‚ both the futile attempts of the aristocracy to maintain its status and of the bourgeoisie to find meaning in its newfound materialism. In reflecting the socio-economic forces at work in Russia at the turn of the 20th century, including the rise of the middle class after the abolition of serfdom in the mid-19th century and the sinking of the aristocracy, the play reflects forces at work around the globe in that period.\n",

Its New England setting and its central warning - see what happens when men salve their consciences by transferring to higher authority their responsibility for moral decisions - seemed to give it perculiar relevance into the political situation in America when it was written (1953), but its implications are much wider. McCarthyism is not the only form of authoritanarianism to which Proctor’s protest in this play might be directed: “Is the accuser always holy now?”; nor was seventeenth-century Salem the only community in which all normal, rational evidence has been for a time either high-handedly disregarded or high-mindedly misinterpreted.\n",

Like John Bunyan’s 1678 Christian novel The Pilgrim’s Progress, Everyman uses allegorical characters to examine the question of Christian salvation and what Man must do to attain it. The premise is that the good and evil deeds of one’s life will be tallied by God after death, as in a ledger book. The play is the allegorical accounting of the life of Everyman, who represents all mankind. In the course of the action, Everyman tries to convince other characters to accompany him in the hope of improving his account. All the characters are also allegorical, each personifying an abstract idea such as Fellowship, (material) Goods, and Knowledge. The conflict between good and evil is dramatised by the interactions between characters. Everyman is being singled out because it is difficult for him to find characters to accompany him on his pilgrimage. Everyman eventually realizes through this pilgrimage that he is essentially alone, despite all the personified characters that were supposed necessities and friends to him. Everyman learns that when you are brought to death and placed before God all you are left with is your own good deeds.\n",

This places the play between Othello and King Lear which may be relevant to it being classified as a ‘dark comedy’; that is, a happy ending but brought about by a series of events of dubious moral standing and ethical content.\n\nReferances topical to Shakespeare’s audience do occur quite frequently, and although these allusions are likely to be lost on present day theatre-goers, there is much which is still very relevant today.

The play begins with a mutual vow reminiscent of the vow beginning the play Lysistrata in which Greek women vow to deny men sex to protest the Peloponnesian War. The three women teachers mutually pledge to abstain from sexual intercourse, in protest against the dominance and abusive treatment of women by men, epitomized in the slur against women as “slags.” Conflicts among the teachers’ different visions of radical feminism, different motivations, and different interpretations of and commitment to the vow become the grist for duplicitous dominant and abusive acts among them and distracts them from their teaching. Dominance and Feminism are ridiculed alike, while the number of pupils dwindles to zero in the resulting dysfunctional environment, leaving the three teachers to go their separate ways.\n\nSlag was a breakthrough play for David Hare. Reputedly written by Hare in three days time, working out of the back of a van, it won for him the Evening Standard (London) Award for most promising new playwright and launched his prolific and successful career as a playwright.\n",

The play is in three acts, normally taking a little less than three hours to perform, with two 10-minute intermissions. The title is a pun on the song “Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?” from Walt Disney’s Three Little Pigs (1933), substituting the name of the celebrated English author Virginia Woolf.

A product of the tolerant early Restoration period, the play reflects an aristocratic and anti-Puritan ideology, and was controversial for its sexual explicitness even in its own time. The title itself contains a lewd pun. It is based on several plays by Molière, with added features that 1670s London audiences demanded: colloquial prose dialogue in place of Molière’s verse, a complicated, fast-paced plot tangle, and many sex jokes. It turns on two indelicate plot devices: a rake’s trick of pretending impotence to safely have clandestine affairs with married women, and the arrival in London of an inexperienced young “country wife”, with her discovery of the joys of town life, especially the fascinating London men.\n\nThe scandalous trick and the frank language have for much of the play’s history kept it off the stage and out of print. Between 1753 and 1924, The Country Wife was considered too outrageous to be performed at all and was replaced on the stage by David Garrick’s cleaned-up and bland version The Country Girl, now a forgotten curiosity. The original play is again a stage favourite today, and is also acclaimed by academic critics, who praise its linguistic energy, sharp social satire, and openness to different interpretations.\n",

I merely tried to follow the book’s undercurrent and to proceed as it does from satiric comedy to drama and then to tragedy. Both the original and the dramatic adaptation start from a certain realism and end up in tragic stylizations. As for the rest, I tried, amidst this cast, preposterous, panting world full of outbursts and scenes of violence, never to lose the threadof suffering and affection that markes Dostoyevsky’s universe so close to each of us. Dostoyevsky’s characters, as we all know well by now, are neither odd nor absurd. They are like us; we have the same heart. And if The Possessed is a prophetic book, this is not only because it prefigures our nihilism, but also because its protagonists are torn or dead souls unable to love and suffering from that inability, wanting to believe and yet unable to do so - like those who people our society and our spiritual world today. The subject of this work is just as much the murder of Shatov (inspired by a real event - the assassination of the student Ivanov by the nihilist Nechayev) as the spiritual adventures of Stavrogin, a contemporary hero. Hence I have dramatized not only one of the masterpieces of world literature but also a work of current application.\n\n\n- Albert Camus\n",

They persuade the Queen to summon Iolanthe and forgive her. On her arrival she reveals that she has a son who is half a fairy - his legs are mortal. Strephon, who now enters, tells his mother and his ‘aunts’ that he is anxious to marry Phyllis, a Ward of Chancery, but is prevented by the Lord Chancellor. The Fairy Queen promises Strephon any help he wishes. After Strephon and Phyllis sing of their love for each other the Peers enter with ‘Loudly Let the Trumpet Bray’. The Lord Chancellor still holds his consent to the marriage between Strephon and Phyllis. Strephon, in despair, consults his mother, but Phyllis (seeing him with a young woman) assumes he is being unfaithful. He calls to the Fairy Queen for help and Act I ends with her and the fairies telling the Peers that Strephon can go into Parliament and wreak havoc there.\nAt the start of Act II, Private Willis, on guard at Westminster, meditates on the political scene. At a second meeting between Phyllis and Strephon, in which Strephon manages to explain his situation, the are reunited and ask Iolanthe to intercede for them with the Lord Chancellor. She does, although if she goe to him and is recognised, she will be condemned to death. Why? - well, we’d hate to spoil the story for you!\n",

First performed on 14 February 1895 at the St James’s Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personæ to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play’s major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play’s humour, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus that it was the culmination of Wilde’s artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde’s most enduringly popular play\n",

The idea for it came in 1970, when Frayn was watching from the wings a performance of The Two of Us, a farce that he had written for Lynn Redgrave. He said, “It was funnier from behind than in front, and I thought that one day I must write a farce from behind.” The prototype, a short-lived one-act play called Exits, was written and performed in 1977. At the request of his associate, Michael Codron, Frayn expanded this into what would become Noises Off. It takes its title from the theatrical stage direction indicating sounds coming from offstage.\n",

He conjures up a storm, the eponymous tempest, to lure his usurping brother Antonio and the complicit King Alonso of Naples to the island. There, his machinations bring about the revelation of Antonio’s lowly nature, the redemption of the King, and the marriage of Miranda to Alonso’s son, Ferdinand.\n",

The play centres on the twins Viola and Sebastian, who are separated in a shipwreck. Viola (who is disguised as a boy) falls in love with Duke Orsino, who in turn is in love with the Countess Olivia. Upon meeting Viola, Countess Olivia falls in love with her thinking she is a man. The play expanded on the musical interludes and riotous disorder expected of the occasion, with plot elements drawn from the short story “Of Apollonius and Silla” by Barnabe Rich, based on a story by Matteo Bandello. The first recorded performance was on 2 February 1602, at Candlemas, the formal end of Christmastide in the year’s calendar. The play was not published until its inclusion in the 1623 First Folio.\n",

Drawing upon their past experience and talents, which included numerous plays, musicals, radio productions and comedy revues, the team first hit the stage in February 1997. It was this comedy show, performed and broadcast from a packed union bar, which threw the first snowball of success that, unbeknown to us, was soon to become an avalanche.\n\n‘We Should Get Out More’s popularity with a student audience resulted in the formation of an award-winning radio comedy programme, broadcast twice weekly throughout Nottingham. Since these early days, the show has gone from strength to strength, broadcasting popular weekly shows across Nottingham and supplementing these with regular productions in the university’s theatre. The entirely original material was judged by the BBC as “Best Student Entertainment Programme 1997”, and then, again, in 1998, “Best Student Entertainment Programme 1998”.\n\nFollowing a 2-week tour around Nottingham, ‘We Should Get Out More’ hit Edinburgh. The show was a runaway success at the 1998 Edinburgh Festival, pulling in capacity crowds and also picking up an award from ‘The Scotsman’.\n",

        "type": "page",
        "group": "docs",
        "content": "Hey! Interested in helping out with the project? We’d love your help.\n\nBoth the project’s content and code to power it are stored in a GitHub repository. As such there are two types of work going on in parallel: editorial and technical. You can help out with either, or both! We plan and track work that needs doing in the issue tracker of our repository.\n\nIf you’re new to Git and GitHub, there are a wealth of resources on their website to get used to the basic technical concepts involved. Don’t worry if you’ve never touched a line of code before - you can still contribute!\n\nWays to contribute\n\n\n  Talk to alumni and collect information and media.\n  Comment on some of the project’s issues, clarifying queries or adding to the discussion.\n  Read through current site content, and click “improve this page” to correct or add information.\n  Find an open issue and submit a proposed fix.\n  Help evaluate open pull requests, by reading through and testing what’s proposed.\n\n\n Collecting Information\n\nWe’ve only collected a subset of all the shows the New Theatre has put on over the years. We need people to reach out to the alumni community and gather both memories of past shows and events and physical media from the time.\n\nIf you fancy helping out, let one of the editors know by sending us an email at history@newtheatre.org.uk.\n\n Issues\n\n\n\nWe use numbered issues to track both technical and editorial work that needs doing. The listing of open issues is public and can be found in our GitHub repository. Each issue can be a quick to-do list item, which is quickly ticked off, or a hub for discussion over a complex task.\n\nThe best way to get started is to read over what’s currently open and start commenting on issues that interest you.\n\n Creating a new issue\n\nSpotted an error on the site, have some information to share, or want to start a discussion on a particular topic? You need to create an issue. Be as descriptive as possible. For example, if the issue involves a problem with the site try and include screenshots or instructions on how to reproduce it. Other contributors can then comment and someone can take a crack at fixing the problem.\n\n Making improvements\n\nGit is a version control system, we use it to keep track of changes to the project’s files. This is a similar system to that used to track the history of articles on Wikipedia. Every change made to every file on the site is logged in a commit, and when you’ve made one or more changes (commits), it can then be merged into the site with a pull request.\n\n Branching and making changes\n\nThe process of getting a change committed and a pull request opened may seem daunting at first, but stick with it. Once you’ve done it the first time it’s not too bad – honest!\n\nForking and branching\n\nFirstly you’ll need to create your own fork of the respository on which to work. This is your own version so you can make your changes without worrying about affecting the main site.\n\nHead over to the repository and hit the  Fork button at the top-right. You’ll need to create a free GitHub account if you don’t have one already. Now you’re ready to start editing!\n\nUsing the web interface (github.com)\n\n\n\n\n  Find the file you want to edit. Shows are stored in the _shows folder, people in _people, etc. See the Editors’ Guide for more information on actually making your edit and how the files are arranged. The Find file button is quite useful for this.\n  Click the  pencil in the top right to start an edit.\n\n\nMaking edits locally on your computer (command line)\n\nThis method requires a certain amount of technical knowledge but is a lot more flexible. It uses Git on the command line, and there are additional guides for getting started there.\n\n\n  Fork the project by clicking “Fork” in the top right corner of newtheatre/history-project.\n  Clone the repository locally git clone https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/history-project.\n  Create a new, descriptively named branch to contain your change git checkout -b my-awesome-change.\n  Using your preferred text editor, make your changes. See the Editors’ Guide for more detailed information on this and the text editors we use.\n\n\nMaking edits locally on your computer (graphical methods)\n\nThe command line isn’t for everyone, and that’s why other bits of software exist. We’ve tried Gitkraken and GitHub Desktop, and the Git website has a full list of options.\n\nThe concept is exactly the same as above: clone, branch and commit.\n\nBuilding the site locally\n\nBy editing on your computer, you can run the entire site and preview changes before pushing them to GitHub. You should have a good knowledge of Git and the command line before doing this.\n\nSee README.md for up to date install instructions.\n\nGetting the site running on your machine locally is easy to do on Mac and Linux. It can be done on Windows, but it’s tricky. The website Run Jekyll on Windows has a full tutorial on how to do this.\n\nWriting a good commit message\n\nUsing git we can see what changed in a particular commit, but a good commit message can tell us why. This is very important for the future when other editors will be updating your work. In the case of show data, they’ll need to know your sources and how credible the information you’ve gathered is.\n\nWhen writing commits, try and adhere to the following rules:\n\n\n  Limit the subject line to about 50 characters.\n  Capitalise the subject line and do not end it with a full stop.\n  Use the imperative tense in the subject line.\n  Use the body to explain what and why.\n\n\nYour subject line should tell us what you’ve done.\n\nAdd crew members to Hamlet (82)\n\nNote we’ve used the imperative Add crew, not the indicative Added crew. To remove any confusion, here’s a simple rule to get it right every time. A good subject line should always be able to complete this sentence: If applied, this commit will &lt;your subject line here&gt;.\n\nThe body, or description should tell us why you’ve done it:\n\nGot information from alumnus Fred Bloggs (BA Archaeology 1984). Spoke on the phone.\n\nWill close #123\n\nNote we’ve specified the years of both the show and the alumnus. This prevents confusion between items with the same name. Also note the referencing of an issue number, doing so in this manner will automatically close the issue when the commit is merged into master.\n\nWhen adding new or changing current information include a source, even if it is yourself.\n\nFor further reading on this topic please see this excellent article: How to Write a Git Commit Message.\n\n Submitting a pull request\n\nNow you’ve made one or more commits it’s time to open a pull request to request a project maintainer to pull in your work to the main repository.\n\nDo bear in mind the smaller the proposed change, the better. If you’d like to propose two unrelated changes, create two branches and submit two pull requests.\n\nAll pull requests get built to a testing environment, and go through some automated code checks. Ensure you have a verified email address with GitHub otherwise your changes will not trigger a build.\n\nJust like commits, it’s possible to add a subject and message for your pull request. It’s useful here to explain what you’ve still got to work on in the message. For example, you could make a pull request for a work in progress (denoted by WIP in the subject) so that others know you’re working on it, but that it’s not ready for merging.\n\nAs other editors of the site will be reviewing your pull request, include in the message what you’d like to draw to their attention such as specific feedback or any help you need.\n\nFor further reading on pull requests do read Ben Balter’s article: The six types of pull requests\n\nSubmitting a pull request via the web interface (github.com)\n\n\n  When commiting your changes select “ Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request”. Enter a short descriptive branch name.\n  Click “Propose file change”\n  Give your PR a descriptive title and description.\n  Click “Create pull request”\n\n\nThat’s it! You’ll be automatically subscribed to receive updates as others review your proposed change and provide feedback.\n\nUsing one of the other software-based options have a very similar process to the one above.\n\nSubmitting a pull request via Git command line\n\n\n  Push the branch up (git push origin my-awesome-change).\n  Create a pull request by visiting https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/history-project and following the instructions at the top of the screen.\n\n\n Testing Pull Requests\n\nThere are a number of ways to review an editor’s pull request, and this can depend on what they’re looking to get out of the review. The basics involve the automated checks, as well as adherence to our style guide, comments, efficiency, and so on.\n\nYou can also make sure the code runs effectively by running it on your own computer by building it, or viewing the edited pages in the test environment. A link to this test environment will be on the pull request page, once it’s built successfully.\n\n Becoming a Contributor\n\nIf you decide making these kinds of edits and contributions is for you, we’d love to have you as part of the team! We’re all volunteers here, and once you’ve had a few pull requests merged you’ll be able to join the list of contributors. This means you won’t have to make your own forks, and can edit the finer details of issues and pull requests.\n\n Anything else\n\nSee the other pages here for more detailed information about each section of the site.\n\nIf you get stuck, or want to help out another way, send us an email at history@newtheatre.org.uk or get in touch with any of the editors.\n\n",

        "content": "This guide will take you through the types of code that are used throughout the site, where it’s all stored, and our approximate coding style we use.\n\nInformation about getting started and how to edit can be found in our Contributors’ Guide.\n\n Languages and Syntaxes Used\n\nWe use different languages and syntaxes for different areas of the site and indeed within files.\n\nContent Pages - Markdown and YAML\n\nMetadata for all content pages is written in YAML, and starts the file. The metadata exists between two --- lines, like so:\n\n---\ntitle: Editors' Guide \n--- \n\nThe Kramdown flavour of Markdown is used for the content of all pages, from shows and people, to about pages and documentation. The Kramdown syntax guide is useful for the technical side of things, while our Style Guide below is helpful for formatting.\n\nTip: YAML doesn’t like tabs at all, or colons in strings. If you’re indenting, use spaces, not tabs. If you’ve got a string (such as a URL or show title) with a colon in it, wrap it in quotes (\"\" or '') and all will be well. \nMore YAML tips can be found on GitHub.\n\nTemplate Pages - HTML and Liquid; CSS and Javascript\n\nThe History Site is a static site powered by Jekyll. It uses HTML to structure its pages, made more powerful with Jekyll’s Liquid templating language. The templates use the metadata (known as frontmatter) to lay the page out in the correct way and put the data in the right places.\n\nYou can learn more about how Jekyll’s templates work by reading their documentation\n\nOur CSS files are compiled using Sass to create a consistent look across all of our pages, and we have a number of Javascript functions running throughout.\n\nAdvanced Functionality - Ruby\n\nMarrying up a vast amount of data with static templates is no mean feat, and sometimes this data needs to be manipulated first. We do that with Ruby.\n\nWe’ve also got some Ruby plugins written for Jekyll on the site which allow us to, for instance, see people’s commitee positions on their profiles.\n\n Where Things Live\n\nWhen first looking at the repository in a text editor, it can seem quite big, and finding where things live will take a bit of time, yet most of the content storage itself is self-explanatory.\n\nThe most commonly edited content files are person, show and venue files.\n\n\n  \n    \n      File\n      Lives in\n      Documentation Link\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Show\n      _shows/\n      Shows\n    \n    \n      Committee\n      _committees/\n      Committees\n    \n    \n      Person\n      _people/\n      People\n    \n    \n      Venue\n      _venues/\n      Venues\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Standalone Pages\n      _content/\n      Above\n    \n    \n      Liquid Template\n      _includes/, _layouts/\n      External - Jekyll\n    \n    \n      Sass and CSS\n      _sass/\n      External - Sass-Lang\n    \n    \n      Ruby Plugins\n      _plugins/\n      External - Jekyll\n    \n  \n\n\nFor each of the below areas, click on the  icon to go to the relevant page of the documentation.\n\nYears \n\nYears are one of the main attributes that are used within the project. These are important to get right and important for many different reasons.\n\nCommittees \n\nNew committees are usually added by a Project Editor at the start of each academic year. Committee files are stored in the _committees/ folder. We do get submissions from alumni with information regarding past committees and these can be added by anyone.\n\nPeople \n\nYou can’t make a show without some people, but the History Project will generate people pages whenever they’re in a list (below). However, dedicated pages can be created to specify things like course, career, photo, or a biography.\n\nPerson Lists \n\nThese are used mainly to populate the cast and crew lists for shows. Check out the documentation for the formatting of lists, which is very important. For people without dedicated profiles, these lists allow for automatic generation of profiles.\n\nVenues \n\nAs well as the New Theatre, we’ve taken shows all over the country, most frequently to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Each venue has its own page where the shows at that venue are listed. We want to know all about these venues, so information can be added in these content pages.\n\nLink Lists \n\nThese are used particularly for reviews placed within show files, but are also used for external links for both people and venues. The list of possible links is expanding as we grow the site, so could change in the future.\n\nTrivia \n\nOne of the things we love collecting for the History Project are little bits of trivia or anecdotes regarding shows. Be this a last minute cast change for one night or something that happened that amused the cast, these stories are a vital part of what makes the NNT the NNT.\n\nPhotos and Assets \n\nThe History Project’s visual records are stored in a SmugMug Site. This ranges from production shots and trailers, to backstage videos and lighting plans. Production shot galleries are public, but other archives, such as our album of headshots, are restricted such that only those with the link may view them in full (though individual photos crop up across the site).\n\nWe’re always looking for more media, no matter the size. Whether it’s photos and videos, or posters and programmes, we’ll have it all. Check out how to upload.\n\nAny binary assets, (pdfs etc.) are stored in a specific folder in the repository. These are stored using Large File Storage, or LFS. if you have any of these type of assets that you think may be useful to the project, please email history@newtheatre.org.uk.\n\n Style Guide\n\nWith many editors on our team, there are many tastes on how certain things should be displayed. To avoid bikeshedding, we’ve documented our preferences. This quick guide only covers content formatting - for code, we strive to cover the best practices of readability and commenting where necessary.\n\nReferencing Titles\n\nGiven not all of the content areas of the site are displayed with Markdown, references to any title (show, TV programme, film, etc.) should be in single quotes ('The Tempest' by William Shakespeare) and not italicised.\n\nQuotes\n\nQuotes should attempt to be as accurate as possible to the source, but understandably with short quotes context can be missed. If you’re omitting part of a quote, insert [...] to indicate so. Cases at the start and end of quotes can be changed without indication (i.e., no need for [T]he).\n\nIf you need to clarify a quote, for instance a name, just add or edit using square brackets. For example, it was brilliant could become ['The Tempest'] was brilliant.\n\nPeople Lists\n\nThere are a few formatting things we do to make sure all of our people lists are consistent.\n\nRole-first\n\nWhen listing people, list their role first and then their name.\n\nMulti-roles\n\nIn many shows, an actor will take on multiple roles. We display these by separating each role with a forward slash, flanked by spaces:\n\n- role: Macbeth / Macduff / Doctor \n  name: John Smith \n\nFor crew, someone taking on multiple roles are listed as separate entries.\n\n- role: Producer\n  name: Jane Doe \n- role: Technical Director \n  name: Jane Doe \n\nOrdering of Names\n\nWhen adding cast to a show file, best practice is to put them in the order they are found in the relevant show’s Programme.\n\nWhen adding crew to a show file, there is a standard order in which roles are listed. This can be found in the skeleton show file.\n",

The built site is hosted from a separate repository by the GitHub Pages service.\n\nSuper Secret Editors’ Mode\n\nIf you type the word editor - go on try it - while this site is active you’ll enable a secret editors’ / debuggy mode. Extra (ugly) content will be shown - for example show counts next to years on the archive page. If these items seem a bit cryptic hover over them and hope someone left a tooltip description.\n\nWith editors’ mode enabled the ‘Improve this page’ dialogue is bypassed.\n",

Websites may close or re-arrange their URLs rendering our links broken. To protect against this editors should create snapshots of resources when they link to them. These snapshots save the state of those resources at a single point in time. Unless the archiving service closes we should have a permanent record of all resources with snapshots.\n\nWe currently use archive.is to create snapshots. Snapshots are created by entering the URL of the resource to be saved on the archive.is website. A page will be returned with a five-character reference code in the URL. For example archiving example.com returns page whose URL is https://archive.fo/oYs92, the reference code is oYs92. This code should be placed in the snapshot attribute of the link list item.\n\n Example Link List\n\nlinks:\n  - type: Example Domain\n    href: \"https://example.com\"\n    snapshot: oYs92\n    title: Example Domain\n  - type: News Story\n    href: \"https://news.com/a-story\"\n    snapshot: abc12\n    title: A Story\n    date: 1980-01-01\n    quote: \"A very interesting quotation.\"\n\n",

Interrogated by two brutal detectives, he claims to know nothing of such murders. But also in their custody is his younger, brain damaged brother, who perhaps knows more than he first lets on. A darkly comic thriller like no other.\n\n",

        "content": " History of the Nottingham New Theatre\n\nThe Nottingham New Theatre is a playhouse and production company based on University Park campus, Nottingham, England. It is funded in part by the University of Nottingham Students’ Union and constitutes one of the Union’s Media Groups (alongside University Radio Nottingham, Nottingham Student Television Station, Impact Magazine, and TEC PA and Lighting).\n\nIt is the only entirely student-run theatre in England, with around 25 individual shows across two seasons per academic year, spanning 6 performances a week, to total around 100 live performances every year.\n\nWith a long and rich history, the Nottingham New Theatre has had a steady stream of members through its doors across many departments for the last 70 years.\n\n1926 - Nottingham Student Players\n\nBefore the Nottingham New Theatre was Dramsoc, and before Dramsoc was Nottingham Student Players. Occasionally including staff alongside students, Nottingham Student Players put on drama and musicals, such as Aucassin and Nicolete (June 4-5th 1926).\n\n1927 - Formation of Dramsoc\n\n\n\nThe University College Nottingham Dramatic Society (Dramsoc) performed its first play in 1928: A.A. Milne’s Mr Pim Passes By.\n\nThe society offered members an opportunity to read, discuss, produce and enact plays.\n\n1940s - Formation of TEC\n\nPreviously The University of Nottingham Technical Executive Committee, and now TEC PA and Lighting, this group had oversight of a number of departments across the university and Students’ Union. The Stage Productions Department was responsible for lighting and sound in the student theatre.\n\nThe SPD Manager also served as Technical Director of Dramsoc, in addition to overseeing the electrics at the annual University Opera, performed in the Great Hall of Trent Building.\n\n1945 - Earliest New Theatre Graduate\n\nThe earliest graduate in our records. Think you can beat that? Just drop us a line.\n\n1958 - Nottingham's Everyman Club\n\nNottingham’s Everyman Club was formed in 1958, to encourage students and local people in the city, who were interested in theatre, to collaborate on productions. The club had some notable successes in the 1960s.\n\n1960s - Golden Age of Dramsoc\n\nThe production of Coriolanus reached the finals of the National Student Drama Competition, while The Taming of the Shew enjoyed a week-long tour of Germany. The society also took George Bernard Shaw’s St Joan to the outdoor Minack Theatre in Cornwall.\n\n1966 - Earliest 'New Theatre' Record\n\nWhile not called the ‘New Theatre’, this is the earliest record of student theatre in Nottingham. At this time, members of the University of Nottingham Technical Committee were responsible for the technical areas of the student theatre.\n\n1980s - Disbandment, and the Nottingham Theatre Group\n\nWhile Dramsoc was disbanded, all was not lost for theatre at Nottingham. The Nottingham Theatre Group (while not receiving any financial support from the Students’ Union) was formed to present an annual revue at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\n\nThese shows were developed and previewed in New Theatre. NTG would typically rent a venue in Edinburgh and fit it out as a temporary theatre, sub-letting the space and equipment to other Fringe groups such as Durham Student Theatre or Bristol Revunions.\n\n2001 - A New Foyer\n\n\n\nThanks to a gracious alumni donation, we were able to fund the construction of our foyer. This housed internal access to the Box Office, toilets, and bar. Its glass exterior created a fresh and open environment for all visitors.\n\n2011 - UNCUT\n\nAnother season of shows allows for more opportunity, and the UNCUT Season—now Fringe—is just that. Providing a platform for experimental, new, or more intimate theatre, this season runs parallel to the In House season. The majority of initial performances were located outside of the Theatre.\n\n2012 - Demolition of Archaeology\n\nThe New Theatre was, up till this point, housed within the department of Archaeology and Classics. Over the summer, the New Theatre became its own freestanding building—now a popular campus landmark. Among several other rooms the foyer was given a generous extension.\n\n2012 - Studios A and B (and more rooms!)\n\n\n\nOur small blackbox studios—used as rehearsal rooms, meeting spaces, performance venues, and occasional bar—were created.\n\nThe costume cupboard and props corridor were also refurbished, providing some long-needed new space.\n\nMatthew Bannister also launched the Seat Dedication Appeal.\n\n2012 - The Nottingham New Theatre\n\nFollowing a members’ vote, The New Theatre became The Nottingham New Theatre, and a new logo was born. This change was made to better represent the theatre on the national stage.\n\n2013 - Nottingham New Theatre meets Lakeside Arts\n\nIn the first of what would become an annual partnership, the students of New Theatre collaborated with the professional theatremakers at Lakeside Arts, another on-campus theatre, to perform Lysistrata.\n\n2015 - STUFF\n\nThe first year of the STUdent Fringe Festival—STUFF—paved the way for future years. An Edinburgh preview event, including shows from external production companies, including Nottingham New Theatre alumni, all coming together to end the summer term on campus.\n\n2016 - 50th Anniversary\n\nThe Nottingham New Theatre’s inaugural alumni dinner took place for the theatre’s 50th Anniversary. Over 100 alumni guests were welcomed to tours of the theatre spaces, followed by a formal dinner in the Great Hall and Senate Chamber.\n\n2017 - Unscripted\n\nUnscripted allows students of any and all experience to take part in the theatre life. With no auditions, the group produces a semi-devised piece. The first performance, held in February, was Camp MacBeth.\n\n",

The Seat Naming project was part of a wider Impact Campaign centred around the building, which included the refurbishment of the seating in the main auditorium, the construction of our two studio spaces and a much needed investment in lighting and sound equipment. All these refurbishments and upgrades were funded by the Students’ Union and donations from Alumni.\n\nMatthew Bannister was heavily involved in the campaigning for the seating and staging. His speech at the launch of the appeal on 16th November 2013 marks the beginning of an appeal that allows alumni to sponsor one of the seats in our main auditorium with a personalised plaque. Any money donated through the appeal will be put towards the continuing updating of the Lighting, Sound and Communications equipment within the building. As well as this, funds will also contribute towards sending students from the Theatre up to the Edinburgh Fringe festival each year.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nThe Stage\n\n\n\n\n  \n  A10: Helen Ward (Now McCallum), English 1970-1973\n\"Four plays a term - how did I get a degree?\"\n\n  \n    \n  \n  &nbsp;\n  \n\n  \n  A9\n  \n    \n  \n  &nbsp;\n  \n\n  \n  A8: Professor Heinrich Fessler\n\n  \n    \n  \n  &nbsp;\n  \n\n  \n  A7: In memory of Neville Bannister, who enjoyed watching his son perform here.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  &nbsp;\n  \n\n  \n  A6: For Tweetie Pie, Love from Sylvester\n1949-1952.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  &nbsp;\n  \n\n  \n  A5: Helen Price (English 1974) & Glyn Price\nWith fond memories.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  &nbsp;\n  \n\n  \n  A4: Richard C Bale\nAncient History & Archaeology 1978-1981.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  &nbsp;\n  \n\n  \n  A3: Enjoyed Dramsoc so much, I got a third\nAudrey Lanclett, English 1967.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  &nbsp;\n  \n\n  \n  A2: Geraldine Slinger & Paul Woodhouse\nEnglish & American Studies and Law 1978.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  &nbsp;\n  \n\n  \n  A1: Marcus Black\nIndustrial Economics 1992.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  &nbsp;\n  A\n\n  \n  B10: Lady Susan Greenaway, MA Children's Literature (2000)\nBA Fine Art (2011)\n\n  \n    \n  \n  &nbsp;\n  \n\n  \n  B9: Sir David Greenaway, Vice-Chancellor 2008-2017,\nProfessor of Economics 1987-2017.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  &nbsp;\n  \n\n  \n  B8\n  \n    \n  \n  &nbsp;\n  \n\n  \n  B7: For my family, Pauline Casimir-Mrowczynske,\nMathematics 1982.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  &nbsp;\n  \n\n  \n  B6: Helen Brady Scott\nM.
